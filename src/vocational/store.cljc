  "SSoT for the technical-and-vocational-secondary-education actor,
  behind a `Store` protocol so the backend is a swap, not a rewrite --
  the same seam every prior `cloud-itonami-isic-*` actor in this fleet
  uses, closely modeled on `cloud-itonami-isic-8521`'s `secondary.
  store`:

    - `MemStore`     -- atom of EDN. The deterministic default for
                        dev/tests/demo (no deps).
    - `DatomicStore` -- backed by `langchain.db`, a Datomic-API-compatible
                        EAV store (datalog q / pull / upsert). Pure `.cljc`,
                        so it runs offline AND can be pointed at a real
                        Datomic Local or a kotoba-server pod by swapping
                        `langchain.db`'s `:db-api` (see langchain.kotoba-db).

  Both implement the same protocol and pass the same contract
  (test/vocational/store_contract_test.clj), which is the whole
  point: the actor, the Curriculum Safeguarding Governor and the audit
  ledger never know which SSoT they run on.

  Like `secondary.store`'s dual grading/graduation history and every
  other dual-actuation sibling before it, this actor has TWO actuation
  events (finalizing a trade/skill certification, finalizing a
  graduation) acting on the SAME entity (a student), each with its OWN
  history collection, sequence counter and dedicated double-actuation-
  guard boolean (`:certification-finalized?`/`:graduation-
  finalized?`, never a `:status` value) -- the same discipline every
  prior sibling governor's guards establish, informed by `cloud-
  itonami-isic-6492`'s status-lifecycle bug (ADR-2607071320).

  Beyond `secondary.store`'s own `integrity-screen-of`, this store
  ALSO carries `safety-screen-of` (workplace/workshop-safety-training
  certification status) -- the genuinely new concern this vertical
  adds, since technical/vocational secondary education characteristically
  involves hands-on practicum work with tools, machinery and
  industrial/workshop equipment in a way `secondary`/8521's own
  general-academic-curriculum focus does not.

  The ledger stays append-only on every backend: 'which student was
  screened for an unresolved academic-integrity flag or an unconfirmed
  workplace-safety-training certification, which certification was
  finalized, which graduation was finalized, on what jurisdictional
  basis, approved by whom' is always a query over an immutable log --
  the audit trail a student/family/employer trusting a vocational
  school needs, and the evidence an operator needs if a certification
  or graduation decision is later disputed."
